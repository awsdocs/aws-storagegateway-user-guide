# Monitoring Storage Gateway<a name="Main_monitoring-gateways-common"></a>

In this section, you can find information about how to monitor a gateway, including monitoring resources associated with the gateway, using Amazon CloudWatch\. You can monitor the gateway's upload buffer and cache storage\. You use the Storage Gateway console to view metrics and alarms for your gateway\. For example, you can view the number of bytes used in read and write operations, the time spent in read and write operations, and the time taken to retrieve data from the Amazon Web Services Cloud\. With metrics, you can track the health of your gateway and set up alarms to notify you when one or more metrics fall outside a defined threshold\.

Storage Gateway provides CloudWatch metrics at no additional charge\. Storage Gateway metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks\. By using these metrics, you can access historical information and get a better perspective on how your gateway and volumes are performing\. Storage Gateway also provides CloudWatch alarms, except high\-resolution alarms, at no additional charge\. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\. For more information about CloudWatch, see [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)\.

## Understanding gateway metrics<a name="MonitoringGateways-common"></a>

For the discussion in this topic, we define *gateway* metrics as metrics that are scoped to the gateway—that is, they measure something about the gateway\. Because a gateway contains one or more volumes, a gateway\-specific metric is representative of all volumes on the gateway\. For example, the `CloudBytesUploaded` metric is the total number of bytes that the gateway sent to the cloud during the reporting period\. This metric includes the activity of all the volumes on the gateway\.

When working with gateway metric data, you specify the unique identification of the gateway that you are interested in viewing metrics for\. To do this, you specify both the `GatewayId` and the `GatewayName` values\. When you want to work with metric for a gateway, you specify the gateway *dimension* in the metrics namespace, which distinguishes a gateway\-specific metric from a volume\-specific metric\. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics](monitoring-volume-gateway.md#UsingCloudWatchConsole-common)\.

## Dimensions for Storage Gateway metrics<a name="storagegateway-metric-dimensions"></a>

The CloudWatch namespace for the Storage Gateway service is `AWS/StorageGateway`\. Data is available automatically in 5\-minute periods at no charge\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  GatewayId, GatewayName |  These dimensions filter the data that you request to gateway\-specific metrics\. You can identify a gateway to work by the value for `GatewayId` or `GatewayName`\. If the name of your gateway was different for the time range that you are interested in viewing metrics, use the `GatewayId`\. Throughput and latency data of a gateway is based on all the volumes for the gateway\. For information about working with gateway metrics, see [Measuring Performance Between Your Gateway and AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-gateway.html#PerfGatewayAWS-common)\.   | 
|  VolumeId  |  This dimension filters the data you request to volume\-specific metrics\. Identify a storage volume to work with by its `VolumeId` value\. For information about working with volume metrics, see [Measuring Performance Between Your Application and Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-gateway.html#PerfAppGateway-common)\.  | 

## Monitoring the upload buffer<a name="PerfUploadBuffer-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's upload buffer and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when the buffer exceeds a specified threshold\. By using this approach, you can add buffer storage to a gateway before it fills completely and your storage application stops backing up to AWS\.

You monitor the upload buffer in the same way in both the cached\-volume and tape gateway architectures\. For more information, see [How Storage Gateway works \(architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\.

**Note**  
The `WorkingStoragePercentUsed`, `WorkingStorageUsed`, and `WorkingStorageFree` metrics represent the upload buffer for stored volumes only before the release of the cached\-volume feature in Storage Gateway\. Now, use the equivalent upload buffer metrics `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree`\. These metrics apply to both gateway architectures\.


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Upload buffer usage |  Use the `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `UploadBufferUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the storage usage over a time period\.  | <a name="PerfUploadBufferMeasuring-common"></a>

**To measure the percent of the upload buffer that is used**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics** dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `UploadBufferPercentUsed` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percent used of the upload buffer\.

Using the following procedure, you can create an alarm using the CloudWatch console\. To learn more about alarms and thresholds, see [Creating CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.<a name="GatewayAlarm1-common"></a>

**To set an upper threshold alarm for a gateway's upload buffer**

1. Configure an email action for the alarm:

   1. On the **Configure Actions** page of the Create Alarm wizard, choose **Alarm** for **Alarm State**\.

   1. Choose **Choose or create email topic** for **Topic**\.

      To create an email topic means that you set up an Amazon SNS topic\. For more information about Amazon SNS, see [Set Up Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SetupSNS.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\.*

   1. For **Topic**, enter a descriptive name for the topic\.

   1. Choose **Add Action**\.

      

   1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. Review the alarm settings, and then create the alarm:

   1. On the **Review** page of the Create Alarm wizard, review the alarm definition, metric, and associated actions to take \(for example, sending an email notification\)\.

   1. After reviewing the alarm summary, choose **Save Alarm**\.

1. Confirm your subscription to the alarm topic:

   1. Open the Amazon SNS email that was sent to the email address that you specified when creating the topic\.

      The following image shows a typical email notification\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/GatewayMetrics_76.png)

   1. Confirm your subscription by clicking the link in the email\.

      A subscription confirmation appears\.

## Monitoring cache storage<a name="PerfCache-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's cache storage and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when parameters of the cache pass specified thresholds\. Using this alarm, you know when to add cache storage to a gateway\.

You only monitor cache storage in the cached volumes architecture\. For more information, see [How Storage Gateway works \(architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\.


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Total usage of cache |  Use the `CachePercentUsed` and `TotalCacheSize` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `CachePercentUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the cache usage over a period of time\. The `TotalCacheSize` metric changes only when you add cache to the gateway\.  | 
| Percent of read requests that are served from the cache |  Use the `CacheHitPercent` metric with the `Average` statistic\. Typically, you want `CacheHitPercent` to remain high\.  | 
| Percent of the cache that is dirty—that is, it contains content that has not been uploaded to AWS |  Use the `CachePercentDirty` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. Typically, you want `CachePercentDirty` to remain low\.  | <a name="PerfCacheDirtyMeasuring-common1"></a>

**To measure the percent of a cache that is dirty for a gateway and all its volumes**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics** dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `CachePercentDirty` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes\.<a name="PerfCacheDirtyMeasuring-common"></a>

**To measure the percent of the cache that is dirty for a volume**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Volume Metrics** dimension, and find the volume that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `CachePercentDirty` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes\.

## Understanding CloudWatch alarms<a name="cloudwatch-alarms"></a>

You can add CloudWatch alarms to your Storage Gateway console and monitor them visually\. When an alarm is present, it turns red when it is in the ALARM state, making it easier for you to monitor its status proactively\. Alarms invoke actions for sustained state changes only\. Alarms don't invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state\. The state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods\. For more information about CloudWatch alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html)\.

**Note**  
If you don't have permission to view CloudWatch, you can't view the alarms\.

For each activated gateway, we recommend that you create the following CloudWatch alarms:
+ High IO wait: `IoWaitpercent` >= 20 for 3 datapoints in 15 minutes
+ Cache percent dirty: `CachePercentDirty` > 80 for 4 datapoints within 20 minutes
+ Availability notifications: `AvailabilityNotifications` >= 1 for 1 datapoints within 5 minutes
+ Health notifications: `HealthNotifications` >= 1 for 1 datapoints within 5 minutes
**Note**  
You can set a health notification alarm only if the gateway had a previous health notification in CloudWatch\.

The following table describes the state of an alarm\. 


| State | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  **OK**  |  The metric or expression is within the defined threshold\.  | 
|  **Alarm**  |  The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold\.  | 
|  **Insufficient data**  |  The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state\.  | 
|  **None**  |  No alarms are created for the gateway\. To create a new alarm, see [Creating an CloudWatch alarm for Storage Gateway](#cloudwatch-alarms-create-alarm)\.  | 
|  **Unavailable**  |  The state of the alarm is unknown\. Choose **Unavailable** to view error information in the **Monitoring** tab\.  | 

### Creating an CloudWatch alarm for Storage Gateway<a name="cloudwatch-alarms-create-alarm"></a>

CloudWatch uses Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) to send alarm notifications when an alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification sent to an Amazon SNS topic\. You can create an Amazon SNS topic when you create a CloudWatch alarm\. For more information about Amazon SNS, see [What is Amazon SNS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

**To create a CloudWatch alarm in the Storage Gateway console**

1. Open the Storage Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/storagegateway/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**\.

1. Choose a gateway, and then choose the alarm state or the **Monitoring** tab\.

1. Do one of the following:
   + If there are no alarms, choose **CloudWatch Alarms**\.
   + If there is an existing alarm, choose **Create alarm**\.

   The CloudWatch console opens\.

1. Create an alarm\. The following are the types of CloudWatch alarms:
   + Static threshold alarm: An alarm based on a set threshold for a chosen metric\. The alarm goes to ALARM state when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods\.

     To create a static threshold alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Anomaly detection alarm: Anomaly detection mines past metric data and creates a model of expected values\. You set a value for the anomaly detection threshold, and CloudWatch uses this threshold with the model to determine the "normal" range of values for the metric\. A higher value for the threshold produces a thicker band of "normal" values\. You can choose whether the alarm is triggered when the metric value is above the band of expected values, below the band, or either above or below the band\.

     To create an anomaly detection alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Anomaly_Detection_Alarm.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Metric math expression alarm: An alarm based one or more metrics used in a math expression\. You specify the expression, threshold, and evaluation periods\.

     To create a metric math expression alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create-alarm-on-metric-math-expression.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Composite alarm: An alarm that determines its alarm state by watching the alarm states of other alarms\. A composite alarm can help you reduce alarm noise\.

     To create a composite alarm, see [Creating a composite alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

1. After you create the alarm in the CloudWatch console, return to the Storage Gateway console\. You can view the alarm by doing one of the following:
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, and then choose a gateway\. On the **Details** tab, for **Alarms**, choose **CloudWatch Alarms**\.
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, then choose a gateway, and then choose the **Monitoring** tab\.
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, and then choose the alarm state of a gateway\.

To edit or delete an alarm, see [Editing or deleting a CloudWatch alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Edit-CloudWatch-Alarm.html)\.
