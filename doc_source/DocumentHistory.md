|  Support for cached volumes and introduction of API Version 2012\-06\-30  |  In this release, AWS Storage Gateway introduces support for cached volumes\. Cached volumes minimize the need to scale your on\-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low\-latency access to their active data\. You can create storage volumes up to 32 TiB in size and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on\-premises application servers\. Data written to your cached volumes is stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\), with only a cache of recently written and recently read data stored locally on your on\-premises storage hardware\. Cached volumes allow you to utilize Amazon S3 for data where higher retrieval latencies are acceptable, such as for older, infrequently accessed data, while maintaining storage on\-premises for data where low\-latency access is required\. In this release, AWS Storage Gateway also introduces a new API version that, in addition to supporting the current operations, provides new operations to support cached volumes\. For more information on the two AWS Storage Gateway solutions, see [How AWS Storage Gateway Works \(Architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\.  You can also try a test setup\.
