## Cleaning up resources you don't need<a name="cleanup-file"></a>

If you created your gateway as an example exercise or a test, consider cleaning up to avoid incurring unexpected or unnecessary charges\.

**To clean up resources you don't need**

1. Unless you plan to continue using the gateway, delete it\. For more information, see [Deleting Your Gateway by Using the Storage Gateway Console and Removing Associated Resources](deleting-gateway-common.md)\.

1. Delete the Storage Gateway VM from your on\-premises host\. If you created your gateway on an Amazon EC2 instance, terminate the instance\.
